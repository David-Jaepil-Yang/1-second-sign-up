# Get Started

## Getting started with GitBook

Welcome! This quick **GitBook getting started guide** helps you get familiar with the **GitBook editor** and the building blocks you’ll use to create and publish documentation.

## Try the GitBook editor (content blocks)

Use this page to play with the editor and get to grips with common **content blocks** (like headings, lists, hints, embeds, and more). Edit a sentence, add a block, and see how your **documentation** starts to take shape.

If you’re new to GitBook, this is the fastest way to understand how pages are built and how Markdown fits into a block-based editor.

## Moving on: core GitBook concepts

Once you’ve had a play, explore the main GitBook concepts:

* **Spaces**: where your docs live (pages, navigation, and publishing) → [Spaces](the-basics/spaces.md)
* **Collections**: how to organize multiple spaces into a structure → [Collections](the-basics/collections.md)
* **The GitBook editor**: your workspace for writing and formatting documentation → [The GitBook editor](the-basics/the-gitbook-editor.md)

Ready? Start with **Spaces** to create your first docs area in GitBook.
